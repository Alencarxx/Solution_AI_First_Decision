joatu;joatu (jack of all trades universe) is a platform for incentivizing hyperlocal community action and getting to know your neighbors. there are two halves to this: projects and trades. for example, the members of a community may want to plant a community garden. someone creates a project and requests volunteers. at a certain place and time, the people come together and do whatever action is needed. all participants are then rewarded in caps: community action points which are automatically generated from project work. initially 1 hour of work = 15 caps. what can you do with caps? this is where the trades come in: people can post requests for things they need and offers for things they have. for example, i might be able to shovel a sidewalk and so i offer to do this for 5 caps (this amount does not need to match the same 1:15 ratio for projects). or i might want help with a problem on my computer, so i offer 20 caps to anyone who can resolve the problem.;1.0;nan;montreal;quebec;4.550.884;-7.358.781;;

cropcure;every year crop farmers run the risk of acquiring the highly contagious, soil-borne disease clubroot, which has the potential to devastate up to 80% of their annual yields. once infected with this disease, it takes farmers up to twenty years to rid the soil of it completely. in alberta alone, there have been 2000 farms that have been infected with clubroot. cropcure is the first natural-based soil treatment that targets clubroot specifically. unlike competitors, cropcure is non-toxic. our powdered formula works with farmers existing machinery (double-barreled seeder) during the seeding process. once the clubroot starts to form, the farmer will realize the need to take action and prompt the use of cropcure. the powder penetrates the topsoil, increasing its alkalinity and making the ground inhospitable to clubroot. the disease causing spores are then essentially frozen in place and unable to reproduce. in as little as 6 weeks, cropcure can reduce the severity and duration of clubroot.;0.0;nan;calgary;alberta;5.105.011;-11.408.528.999.999.900;;
